Generates maps intended to be played in a format similar to the following video: https://youtu.be/Te8Gbbzdaw0?si=2UVruWt7hV9xfNRE

Tile assets created by JayMonoto, who also asked me to create this program.

When a map is generated it will automatically be saved in the user's pictures folder.

To adjust the specifications of the map click the girl on the right where you can adjust variables for each tiles, and global variables such as the null weight and number of tiles.
To regenerate a map, click the girl on the left.
Clicking the button at the top will remove all lines.

This program currently does nothing to fix islands or unsolvable boards, with the reasoning being it adds to the intended chaos, and a route could just be drawn in after if desired.
